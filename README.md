# Spherical-Inverter
A MATLAB-based GUI application that visualizes three-dimensional spherical inversion. Performs inversion on spheres, cylinders, ellipsoids, custom point sets, and MATLAB functions passed by user.

## Abstract
Inversion in three-dimensions occurs with respect to a reference sphere, whose origin and radius dictate the shape of the inverted object/shape. While a relatively simple transformation maps points from an original ob- ject to the inverted object, conceptualizing this transformation is better understood with the help of visualization. Our MATLAB simulation ap- plication helps to visualize the inversion of three-dimensional shapes by creating animations of an objectâ€™s transformation. Additionally, stereo- graphic projection, an instance of Spherical inversion, can be better un- derstood with the help of simulations created by our application.
