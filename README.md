# Spherical-Inverter
A MATLAB-based GUI application that visualizes three-dimensional spherical inversion. Performs inversion on spheres, cylinders, ellipsoids, custom point sets, and MATLAB functions passed by user.

## Abstract
Inversion in three-dimensions occurs with respect to a reference sphere, whose origin and radius dictate the shape of the inverted object/shape. While a relatively simple transformation maps points from an original object to the inverted object, conceptualizing this transformation is better understood with the help of visualization. Our MATLAB simulation application helps to visualize the inversion of three-dimensional shapes by creating animations of an objectâ€™s transformation. Additionally, stereo- graphic projection, an instance of Spherical inversion, can be better understood with the help of simulations created by our application.
